## Inspiration
Valentine’s Day occurs every February 14. Across the United States and in other places around the world, candy, flowers and gifts are exchanged between loved ones, all in the name of St. Valentine. Valentine was a priest who served during the third century in Rome. When Emperor Claudius II decided that single men made better soldiers than those with wives and families, he outlawed marriage for young men. Valentine, realizing the injustice of the decree, defied Claudius and continued to perform marriages for young lovers in secret. When Valentine’s actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death.

Inspired from good deeds of St. Valentine, we made this project "Share Love". Just like St. Valentine, we want to encourage people to help others.

## What it does?
We have designed a hardware and an app. The hardware can be connected to the app through bluetooth. Everytime when you help someone for a good cause, you get love points. Even your family members gets to know, when you put your inputs in the app. Everytime, you do a social work, the "Family Heart" glows up. In our app, we even have a chat room, where you along with your family members can chat. There is even a leader board where you can know who among your family members is leading. So you can also know their points.

We think this project of ours might encourage people to help others. Even their well deed can be recognised by their family members.

## How it was built?
The flutter app was built using dart language. It works for both Android and IOS. The website, which gives a basic vision of our project, was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. Our hardware model "Family Heart" was built with Arduino nano, Lipo battery, HC-05 bluetooth module and LED lights. We used cockroachdb to keep the count of visitors.

## Challenges we've faced
This was our first time developing an app. None of us were had even tried app development before. While making the app, there were lots of bugs. But, eventually we completed our app for this project. We also were new to Cockroach-db. We thought to build the back end of our app using cockroach db, but it didn't work well. So we used cockroachdb to keep the count of visitors.

## Accomplishment that we're proud of
We are really happy to get our project done within the time frame.

## What's next for the project
We are planning to make the app interface more user friendly. We hope this project can bring a positive change in our society.
